# Codeup Bootcamp Pre-work

The Codeup Bootcamp is an immersion programming bootcamp that creates web developers.

During this pre-work course, we will learn about the languages and technologies used in web development.

## A note from our instructors

Dear programming student,

First of all, thank you so much for choosing Codeup. We understand that you have taken a huge step forward to change your career and life. In order to best prepare you for the challenges ahead, we have written and designed this prework book to familiarize you with the concepts and topics we will be discussing in further detail in our class.

Our course work moves at a rapid pace, and will cover a great deal of material in a very short period of time, but our focus is to help you understand the fundamentals of how to build a web application from scratch and have 95% of the things you need to know before you start a programming job. The other 5% will be learned on the job.

You will be pushed to learn things quickly, to make mistakes and correct them as soon as possible, and you will be coding from day one. There will be only a few moments when your computer is not being used for coding, and those moments are used to develop you as a professional. You need to be hirable, of course, and we want to make sure you are ready to start a great career in programming as soon as you complete the program.

It's going to be tough and fast-paced, but you were chosen to be a part of this program for a reason, and we are going to do our best to ensure that you get a job after Codeup. If you don't succeed, that means we failed, and we should not profit off of that.

Once again, thank you for choosing Codeup. You are in great hands.
